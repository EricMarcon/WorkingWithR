This book proposes an organization of work around R and RStudio to, beyond statistics, write documents efficiently with R Markdown, in various formats (memos, scientific articles, student theses, books, slide shows), create its website and online R applications (Shiny), produce packages and use R for teaching.
It is the English translation of [Travailler avec R](https://ericmarcon.github.io/travailleR/).

It is continuously updated [for online reading](https://EricMarcon.github.io/WorkingWithR/) and can be [downloaded as a PDF file](https://ericmarcon.github.io/WorkingWithR/WwR.pdf).
